CPROVER is a framework of software analysis tools. See https://www.cprover.org/
for further information about the tools, publications, and the pointers to
source code.

This archive contains the following files:

- jbmc-binary: this is the actual verification tool. It takes Java bytecode
  (class files) as input and checks the properties specified by command-line
  flags.

- jbmc: this wrapper script invokes jbmc-binary, parsing the property file to
  pass the correct flags to jbmc-binary and returning the correct return codes
  for SV-COMP.

The binaries were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS; the binaries
should be self-hosting on similar operating systems.  The upstream URL, if
you wish to compile it yourself, is https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc

To use the tool, run the tool passing a class or jar file as argument.
Compile sources with Java 8. Using -g is recommended to obtain more
readable counterexample traces.

For SV-COMP, use the wrapper script provided in this distribution, which takes
the following options:
  <path(s)> to sources
  --32 or --64: set the bit width
  --propertyfile <file>: read SV-COMP property specification from <file>
  --graphml-witness <file>: write SV-COMP witness to <file>
